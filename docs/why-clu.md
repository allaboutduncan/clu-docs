# Why Choose CLU?

There are a lot of comic servers out there. Some are better than others, but they all serve a similar purpose: to read your comics.

Most servers like **Komga** and **Kavita** are fantastic **Readers**. They excel at metadata consumption and reading. 

**CLU** is different. CLU is a **Manager**.

## The CLU Difference

CLU was built for the curator. For the collector who wants to fix a messy filename, delete an ad page from a CBZ, or restructure their folders without leaving the browser.

| Feature | CLU | Komga | Kavita | ComicRack (Win) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Read Comics** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Manage Files** (Move/Rename) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Edit Archives** (Delete/Crop Pages) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Batch Improve** (Upscale/Enhance) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Download** (GetComics/Metron) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Platform** | Docker/Web | Docker/Web | Docker/Web | Windows Desktop |

## Key Features

### 1. Edit Your Comics
CLU allows you to open a CBZ/CBR file and modify it directly:

*   **Crop Covers:** Remove borders or text from covers.
*   **Delete Pages:** Remove ads or unwanted pages.
*   **Add Pages:** Insert missing pages or covers.

No other self-hosted server allows this level of granular control.

### 2. File Management First
CLU respects your filesystem.

*   **Move & Rename:** Organize your library structure from the UI.
*   **Series Mapping:** Easily map series to your existing folders.

### 3. Integrated Downloads and Metadata
Expand your collection and get metadata without leaving the app.

* **Metron:** View weekly releases, search series and get metadata.  
* **GetComics Integration:** Search and download directly.
* **ComicVine:** Used as a secondary source for metadata.
* **Grand Comics Database:** Locally running clone can be user for quick, bulk metadata updates.

Use **Mylar3** if you want to set-it-and-forget-it for new releases. Use **CLU** if you want to find specific back-issues, curate your library, or fix existing files.

## Who is CLU for?

*   **The Curator:** You want your files perfectly named and organized.
*   **The Editor:** You want to fix that one issue with the low-res cover.
*   **The Collector:** You want to find and download new issues easily.

If you just want to read, Komga is great. If you want to **manage**, get CLU.
