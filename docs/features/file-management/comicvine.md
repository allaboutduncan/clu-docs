# ComicVine Metadata

If you have entered a [Commicvine API Key](../app-settings/download-settings.md#metadata-api-configuration) in settings, you'll see an additional icon in the File Manager. Clicking the <i class="bi bi-book fs-2 text-success"></i> icon will beging searching for metadata from ComicVine.

!!! info "Single Issue Metadata Only"
    The **ComicVine** feature only searches for metadata for a single issue. If you have multiple issues in a directory, you will need to use the [GCD Database Method](../gcd-settings/index.md) feature to process multiple issues. [ComicRackCE](https://github.com/maforget/ComicRackCE) should be your first choice for performing large metadata updates if you want to use ComicVine.

### Manually Search for Metadata

Clicking the <i class="bi bi-book fs-2 text-success"></i> will begin searching for metadata from ComicVine. If there are multiple matches, a modal will open, prompting you to select the correct match. If there is only one match, the metadata will be applied automatically.

### Additional ComicVine Settings

Additional settings can be found in the [Download Settings --> Metadata API Configuration](../app-settings/download-settings.md#metadata-api-configuration).

#### Metadata Added on File Move

If enabled, when you move a file to a new location the metadata will be applied automatically if the following criteria are met:

- There is a valid `cvinfo` file in the same directory
- There is no `ComicInfo.xml` file

#### File Renamed when Metadata is Added

If this feature is enabled, when a `ComicInfo.xml` file is generated by ComicVine, the file will be renamed to match your configured [Custom Rename Pattern](../app-settings/file-settings.md#custom-rename-pattern-settings).

#### File Moved when Metadata is Added

If this feature is enabled, when a `ComicInfo.xml` file is generated by ComicVine, the file will be moved to match your configured [Custom Move Pattern](../app-settings/download-settings.md#custom-move-pattern).
