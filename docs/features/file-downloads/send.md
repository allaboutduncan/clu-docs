# Click to Download

## Supported Sites

Currently, GetComics.org and [Comic Book Plus](https://comicbookplus.com) are supported for downloads.

As you browse these sites and find a book you'd like to read, v2 of the extension will append a `CLU` icon next to the supported download link(s).

![Click to send to CLU](../../assets/download/append.png){: .center-image}

Clicking this will send the download request to CLU and you'll see it show up in the download status page.

Some older style links may not have the icon appended. In this case, you can right click one of the [supported download providers](send.md#supported-providers) and you should see `Send to CLU` in your context menu

You can then navigate to the Download Status page in CLU (http://localhost/status) and watch the progress of the file download
