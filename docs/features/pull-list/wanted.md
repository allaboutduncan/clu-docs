# Wanted

![Wanted](../../assets/pull/wanted.png){: .center-image}

The wanted page will show you all missing and upcoming issues for the series you are subscribed to. We'll review the difference between missing and upcoming issues below.

At the very top, you'll see 3 buttons that perform actions related to the *Wanted* issues.

### Refresh

Checks all series in your Pull List and refreshes your _Wanted_ and _Missing_ issues.

### Scan Download Directory

This will scan your download directory to check for any files that may have been placed there since the last scan. This same process is triggered when a file or file(s) are moved to your TARGET directory.

### Check for Missing Issues

This will manually run the job to check **GetComics** for any issues in your _Wanted_ list.

## Missing Issues

Missing issues are issues that are missing from your collection that have a **Store Date** that is in the past.

The Missing Issues list is sorted by the **Store Date** in from oldest to newest.

### Search for Missing Issues

For missing issues in your collection, you can search for them on GetComics.org without leaving CLU. Simply click on the <i class="bi bi-search text-info"></i> **Search** button next to the issue.

This will open a modal and begin searching for the issue on GetComics.org. 

![Searching for Issue](../../assets/pull/search01.png){: .center-image}

The modal will show you the results of the search and allow you to add the issue to your collection by clicking the <i class="bi bi-download text-info"></i> Download button next to the issue. This will [send the issue to your download queue](../file-downloads/send.md). 

![Refining the Search](../../assets/pull/search02.png){: .center-image}

You can adjust the terms in the modal to refine your search in an attempt to find the issue you are looking for.

## Upcoming Issues

![Upcoming](../../assets/pull/upcoming.png){: .center-image}

This section will show you all upcoming issues for the series you are subscribed to. The issues are sorted by the **Store Date** in from oldest to newest.

This is simply a list of upcoming releases. Once the **Store Date** has passed, the issue will move to the **Missing Issues** section if it is not in your collection.
