## Weekly Releases

The Weekly Releases page will show you a list of all comics that are slated to release for the current week.

Clicking on a comic on the weekly release page will take you to the series page for that comic. From there you can perform multiple actions:

- Subscribe to the comic
- Map to an existing series or update the mapping location 
- Check the API for new issues
- Check your local folder for missing/newly added issues
- Remove the series from your pull list

Continue on to the series page to learn more about each of these actions.
