# Remove First Image

![Remove First Image](../../assets/single/remove.png){: .center-image }

Accessible in the [File Manager view](../file-management/index.md) or [Collection view](../collection/index.md), via the <i class="bi fs-2 bi-three-dots-vertical text-dark"></i> dropdown menu. 

Many older files will have a cover image that is not the cover of the comic.

Use this utility to remove the first image in the file.

!!! danger
    The process is not reversible, and the file will be deleted. Occassionally, the first image is not the cover, and this utility will remove the cover by mistake. I reccomend using the [Edit File](edit.md) feature to remove the cover on the first occurrence, to ensure the cover is not removed by mistake.
