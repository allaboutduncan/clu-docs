# Crop Cover

![Crop Cover](../../assets/single/crop.png){: .center-image }

Accessible in the [File Manager view](../file-management/index.md) or [Collection view](../collection/index.md), via the <i class="bi fs-2 bi-three-dots-vertical text-dark"></i> dropdown menu. 

Use this tool to crop a cover that is front & back, to front only.

The wraparound cover is not deleted, but re-ordered in the CBZ to be the 2nd image.
