# Enhance Images

![Enhance Images](../../assets/single/enhance.png){: .center-image }

Accessible in the [File Manager view](../file-management/index.md) or [Collection view](../collection/index.md), via the <i class="bi fs-2 bi-three-dots-vertical text-dark"></i> dropdown menu. 

Looking at scans from books that were published in decades past or by now defunct publishers, there quick and easy image enhancements that could be done to the images.

This function will run an image enhancement algorithm (documented below) on all images in the specified CBZ file.

Below are a few _Before/After_ examples&#x20;

<table><thead><tr><th width="375" align="center">Before</th><th align="center">After</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><img src="https://github.com/allaboutduncan/comic-utils/raw/main/images/enhance-before.webp" alt=""></td><td align="center"><img src="https://github.com/allaboutduncan/comic-utils/raw/main/images/enhance-after.webp" alt=""></td></tr><tr><td align="center"></td><td align="center"></td></tr></tbody></table>
